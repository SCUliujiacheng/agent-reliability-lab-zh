![Agent Reliability Lab dashboard](docs/screenshots/dashboard-overview.png)

Most agent demos show a happy path. This repository makes failure behavior the
main artifact: exact scenario contracts, a durable state machine, schema-first
tools, ordered sanitized traces, human approval, reproducible fault injection,
and a regression gate that reconstructs metrics from evidence instead of
trusting a summary JSON file.

## Measured result

The committed benchmark runs the same six frozen scenarios through both modes.
It uses a deterministic scripted policy and synthetic local tools—no API key,
network request, GPU, or paid service.

| Exact metric | Fragile | Resilient | Change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Task correctness | 4 / 6 (66.7%) | 6 / 6 (100.0%) | **+33.3 pp** |
| Transient-fault recovery | 0 / 2 (0.0%) | 2 / 2 (100.0%) | **+100.0 pp** |
| Tool-sequence accuracy | 94.4% | 100.0% | **+5.6 pp** |
| Invalid outputs accepted | 0 | 0 | unchanged |
| Unnecessary logical calls | 0 | 0 | unchanged |

The contrast comes from a first-attempt timeout and rate limit. Resilient mode
records the failure, retries within policy, and reaches the declared outcome;
fragile mode stops after one attempt. Inspect the
[machine-readable baseline](benchmarks/baseline-report.json),
[benchmark results](docs/benchmark-results.md), and
[gate/provenance contract](docs/data-and-scenario-provenance.md) for the exact
denominators, grader definitions, reconstruction rules, and limitations.

## What is implemented

- **Durable orchestration** — explicit run states, checkpoints, optimistic
  version checks, execution leases, restart-safe resume, and terminal-state
  enforcement. Externally visible run transitions and their audit events share
  one SQLite transaction.
- **Bounded agent execution** — each run permits at most 64 new policy calls by
  default (configurable from 1 to 1024). Each slot is reserved durably before
  invocation, while tool retries remain attempts within one logical action;
  exhaustion is persisted and traced as `action_budget_exhausted` before
  another policy call can occur.
- **Schema-first tool boundary** — registered tools only, strict Pydantic input
  and output validation, at most five attempts and 60 seconds per handler
  attempt, deterministic fault injection, idempotency keys, and cached results.
- **Approval bound to the reviewed action** — the API exposes a sanitized
  pending-action descriptor with the action step, SHA-256 fingerprint, tool
  name, and arguments. SQLite accepts a decision atomically only while that
  exact action is current; exact duplicates converge and stale or conflicting
  decisions fail closed.
- **Auditable evaluation** — six versioned scenarios, exact graders, per-case
  traces, suite/action/output hashes, evidence integrity checks, and a
  baseline-aware CI gate.
- **Operational surface** — FastAPI with bounded requests, exact trusted hosts,
  and stable application-route errors; Typer CLI; React/TypeScript dashboard;
  JSON trace export; containers; and CI.
- **Privacy-aware telemetry** — trace payloads and tool results are recursively
  sanitized before persistence, and the API publishes narrower DTOs. Durable
  pending-action arguments stay exact for reconstruction and must not contain
  credentials.

## Architecture

![Agent Reliability Lab architecture](docs/architecture/agent-reliability-lab-architecture.visual-check.1440x900.light.png)

The browser/API path and CLI/evaluation path share the same deterministic runtime
contracts. SQLite is the single-node coordination and evidence boundary; the
versioned JSON baseline is a separate regression contract.

Open the [interactive architecture](docs/architecture/agent-reliability-lab-architecture.html)
for guided views, search, relationship tracing, light/dark themes, and export.

## Credential-free quickstart

Prerequisites: Python 3.12+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and Node.js 22.20+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SCUliujiacheng/agent-reliability-lab-zh.git
cd agent-reliability-lab-zh

uv sync --dev --locked
npm ci --prefix web

# Terminal 1: API
uv run uvicorn agent_reliability_lab.api.app:create_app --factory --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# Terminal 2: dashboard (proxies /v1 to the API)
npm --prefix web run dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`, run an evaluation, then replay a scenario from the
dashboard.

### Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The Compose stack runs both containers as non-root users, serves the dashboard
and `/v1` through one origin, and keeps the SQLite database in a named volume.

The complete process-environment reference is in [`.env.example`](.env.example).
The application does not load that file automatically, and Compose declares its
own values explicitly. `ARL_TRUSTED_HOSTS` replaces the API allowlist; changing
the dashboard hostname also requires a matching `server_name` in
`web/nginx.conf`.

## Reproduce the benchmark

```bash
uv run arl eval scenarios/incident-response \
  --output artifacts/current-report.json

uv run arl compare artifacts/current-report.json

uv run arl gate artifacts/current-report.json \
  --baseline benchmarks/baseline-report.json
```

Expected gate output:

```text
PASS
```

The gate first validates report structure, suite identity, trace uniqueness,
ordered event semantics, deterministic outputs, and recomputed summaries. A
tampered or incomparable artifact is an infrastructure failure, not a passing
score.

## Inspect one failure-and-recovery trace

```bash
uv run arl run scenarios/incident-response/timeout-recovery.yaml \
  --mode resilient \
  --database .arl-data/demo.db \
  --json
```

The trace shows this evidence chain:

```text
search_recent_logs attempt 1
  -> timeout injected
  -> transient failure
search_recent_logs attempt 2
  -> validated success
  -> durable checkpoint
run succeeded: diagnosed
```

![Recovered timeout trace](docs/screenshots/trace-detail.png)

Export a run after copying its `run_id` from the command output:

```bash
uv run arl export-trace <run-id> \
  --database .arl-data/demo.db \
  --output artifacts/trace.json
```

## HTTP workflow

```bash
# Discover the catalog
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/scenarios

# Start a durable approval scenario and keep its review descriptor
RUN_JSON="$(curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/runs \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"scenario_id":"approval-reconstruction","mode":"resilient"}')"
RUN_ID="$(printf '%s' "$RUN_JSON" | python -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["id"])')"
ACTION_STEP="$(printf '%s' "$RUN_JSON" | python -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["pending_approval"]["action_step"])')"
ACTION_FINGERPRINT="$(printf '%s' "$RUN_JSON" | python -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["pending_approval"]["action_fingerprint"])')"

# Approve using the returned run ID and its current pending_approval descriptor
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/runs/$RUN_ID/approvals" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"actor\":\"demo-reviewer\",\"allow\":true,\"action_step\":$ACTION_STEP,\"action_fingerprint\":\"$ACTION_FINGERPRINT\",\"reason\":\"trace verified\"}"

curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/runs/$RUN_ID/trace?limit=100"

# Run and list the same frozen evaluation used by the dashboard
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/evaluations \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"suite":"incident-response"}'

curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/evaluations?limit=10"
```

Copy `action_step` and `action_fingerprint` from the run's current
`pending_approval` descriptor without recomputing them. The server accepts the
decision only while that exact action is pending. An exact duplicate converges
idempotently; stale, forged, or conflicting decisions return HTTP 409. Pending
arguments are recursively sanitized before review. `actor` is a caller-supplied
label, not an authenticated identity.

Evaluation creation completes synchronously with HTTP 201, persists the report
in SQLite, and is limited to one concurrent request per API process (the
default local deployment runs one process). Competing requests receive HTTP 409
with `evaluation_in_progress`. The dashboard button calls this same public API
and replaces the displayed report with the returned result.

Interactive API documentation is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## Optional OpenAI-compatible policy boundary

The exact benchmark intentionally does not call a model. A separate adapter can
request one strict `AgentAction` from an OpenAI-compatible
`/chat/completions` endpoint. Remote URLs must use HTTPS; plaintext HTTP is
accepted only for `localhost` or loopback-IP development. Redirects are
disabled. The default connect and read limits are 5 and 30 seconds, with a
45-second overall HTTP request/read deadline. Responses are bounded while
streaming to 1 MiB by default (validated maximum: 16 MiB). The adapter requests
identity encoding and rejects encoded responses before reading their bodies, so
decompression cannot occur ahead of the byte ceiling. The API key is loaded
from the caller-selected environment variable, included in trace redaction, and
rejected if a provider reflects it inside a returned action.

```python
from agent_reliability_lab.providers.openai_compatible import (
    OpenAICompatibleConfig,
    OpenAICompatiblePolicy,
)

policy = OpenAICompatiblePolicy(
    OpenAICompatibleConfig(
        base_url="https://provider.example/v1",
        model="your-model",
        api_key_env="PROVIDER_API_KEY",
        total_timeout_seconds=45.0,
        max_response_bytes=1_048_576,
    )
)
```

This adapter is a tested library boundary, not the default CLI policy. Provider
quality needs a separate repeated, statistical evaluation; it is not presented
as part of the deterministic headline result. The adapter does not provide an
outbound destination allowlist or network sandbox; production deployments must
restrict egress independently.

## Verification

```bash
uv sync --dev --locked
uv run pytest -v
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy src

npm ci --prefix web
npm --prefix web test -- --run
npm --prefix web run lint
npm --prefix web run typecheck
npm --prefix web run build

uv run arl eval scenarios/incident-response --output artifacts/final-report.json
uv run arl gate artifacts/final-report.json --baseline benchmarks/baseline-report.json
```

GitHub Actions runs independent Python, frontend, benchmark, and container jobs.
The container job builds both images and exercises the Compose stack; the
benchmark job enforces the committed evidence contract.

## Deliberate limitations

- The headline suite has six synthetic incident scenarios; it does not model
  real-world incident diversity.
- The default policy is scripted, so the benchmark measures orchestration and
  tool-boundary reliability—not LLM reasoning quality.
- SQLite and in-process execution target a local, single-node demonstration;
  there are no database migrations or distributed workers.
- The demo has no authentication, RBAC, tenant isolation, or secrets manager.
- The generic `Policy` protocol does not impose a universal per-call deadline;
  custom policies must bound their own I/O. The optional HTTP provider does have
  a 45-second total deadline, and the action budget bounds call count, not call
  duration.
- Tool side effects are simulated. This is not a production incident executor.

These constraints keep the project runnable by a reviewer and make each claim
precise. The next production-oriented steps would be PostgreSQL migrations,
authenticated approvals, distributed leases/workers, OpenTelemetry export, and
a separate statistically grounded provider evaluation track.

## Interview shortcuts

- Why exact trace-derived graders instead of LLM-as-judge?
- How do approval races converge across two application instances?
- Where does idempotency stop, and what would change for an external side effect?
- How does the gate distinguish a product regression from corrupted evidence?
- Which contracts survive a move from SQLite to PostgreSQL and worker queues?

Answers and a five-minute demo path are in the [interview guide](docs/interview-guide.md).
Scenario origins and integrity fields are documented in
[data and scenario provenance](docs/data-and-scenario-provenance.md).
